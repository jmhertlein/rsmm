add a "long term stats" frame that shows total profit all time, last month, last week, etc. Also shows for each item: total profit, total volume, avg profit per turn, avg turn volume
make clicking a turn auto-sync the quotes table to quote for the item for that turn
factor quotes into GE limit usage
add support for "synthetic" quotes- a synthetic quote will have a flag in the db indicating it's fake (so research can exclude it), and only non-synthetic quotes will factor into GE limit usage
